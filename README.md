Overview of The Project:
This project is a Python program that allows users to track and manage student grades for various subjects or assignments. The main features of the program include:
Grade Input: Users can input grades for different subjects or assignments. The program will allow multiple inputs and can handle both numeric grades and weightings for different subjects.

Grade Calculation: The program will calculate the average grade based on the inputted grades and can also take into account weightings (e.g., assignments vs exams).

Overall Grade: The program will display the overall grade, including a letter grade and GPA (Grade Point Average). Letter grades will be determined based on the numerical average, and the GPA will be calculated using a standard scale.

Additional Information: Additional information about the studentâ€™s performance can be displayed, such as:

Letter grade
GPA (based on a 4.0 scale)
If the student is passing or failing.
